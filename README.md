# Amazon Discounts App using RAG based LLM
Amazon Discount App extracts real-time discounts and prices of products from Amazon. It leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance the accuracy and relevancy of the data retrieval. The project is built using Pathwayâ€™s LLM App features, enabling the construction of a real-time, LLM-enabled data pipeline in Python.

### Current Updates
-Cloned the pathway's llm-app repository into the local system named as "llm-app" which contains the dependencies to build a RAG pipeline.
-Generated a unique GEMINI API key and stored it in a .env file
-

### Future Plans for project
-Create an in-memory persistent vector store with real-time document indexing using Pathway that can easily work with documents in online storage or local directory.
-Integrate it with LlamaIndex
