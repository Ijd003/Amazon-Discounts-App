# Amazon Discounts App using RAG based LLM
Amazon Discount App extracts real-time discounts and prices of products from Amazon. It leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance the accuracy and relevancy of the data retrieval. The project is built using Pathwayâ€™s LLM App features, enabling the construction of a real-time, LLM-enabled data pipeline in Python.
